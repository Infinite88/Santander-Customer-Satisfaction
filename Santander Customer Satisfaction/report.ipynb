    "Because trying to predict whether a customer is satisfied or unsatisfied with their service, this becomes a supervised, classification problem. The metric that is used to evaluate the model is the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC). \n",
    "\n",
    ">The receiver operating characteristic (ROC), or ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The true-positive rate is also known as sensitivity, or recall. The false-positive rate is also known as the fall-out and can be calculated as (1 - specificity). The ROC curve is thus the sensitivity as a function of fall-out. The advantage of the roc curve is that it explores all possible setting of the threshold.\n",

    "I really enjoyed working on this project. I found it to very interesting in trying to predict if a customer will be satisfied or not with a company's service. With the data set being anonymized, it makes it very hard to explore what each feature actually means and to truly explain the true importance of a feature to another. I also found out that the more complexed ensemble method had better performance scores than simple classifiers. Although the tuning of the model's parameters increased the the final score, methods like feature engineering, creating ensemble of models, stacking, etc may improve the model significantly. Although this would be a good thing, it may take a long time to train."
